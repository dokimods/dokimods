The story follows a redesigned protagonist and his experience joining the club. By redesign, I mean he was given a personality different to the base game, as well as a past that will play into his general outlook and interactions with the dokis. He\'s sort of a blend between the personalities of the protagonists from these stories: \\"My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU,\\" \\"Bunny-Girl Senpai,\\" and \\"The Fruit of Grisaia.\\" I\'ve never played the mod \\"Fruits of the Literature Club\\", so there may be a slight overlap due to our similar inspirations, but if there is it will likely be negligible. With that explained, what about the game-play?There will be 10~11 \'routes\' available, though that doesn\'t mean you\'ll have to play through the mod that many times. Each girl has two routes, a lover route and a friend route. You can only do one lover route at a time (so no harem), but you could technically clear multiple friend routes in a single playthrough. To give an idea, it\'s a similar system to what you would see in a Persona game.Two new characters are also introduced (hence the 10~11 routes), but one of them is totally optional if new characters aren\'t your thing.The potential of a stat system exists. Again, this is a similar system to what you\'d see in a Persona game, with there being four \\"stats\\" that can be raised to unlock new scenes and interactions.
