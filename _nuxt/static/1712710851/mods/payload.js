After spending what feels like eons in the void, Monika decides she was wrong and gives a shot at restoring the game to its former state. However, the script isn't as stable as she might have thought, giving birth to horror and grief for our beloved MC, leaving him to traipse through a weathered world where colors fade and flowers wilt.
