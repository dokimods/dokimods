His more mysterious, reserved nature usually results in him taking a backseat (or just staying out of) most social environments, seeing no use in getting involved in any types of extracurricular activities. On the other end of the spectrum, there's the normal MC who's already established in the club and preparing for said 'festival'. He's the one we all know and love, so I'm sure you'll know him already.
