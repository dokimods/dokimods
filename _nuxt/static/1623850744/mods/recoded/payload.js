Monika restores what she can of the game's broken code, but doesn't have the ability to restore it fully. She instead gives the player a chance to do so, hoping that by making the right choices, everything will return to the way it once was.You'll have many choices, and each choice will impact the story. Each Doki gets their own route with branching dialogue and multiple endings.
