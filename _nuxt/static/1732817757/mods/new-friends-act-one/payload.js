Monika, however, deals with the existential crisis that comes with being self-aware in a game. What I want to do with Doki Doki New Friends is tell a story about Monika where she doesn't struggle with such a \"meta\" problem. Instead, Monika struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder and intrusive thoughts. On top of that, she has moved to a new school and as the title might imply has to make new friends. Follow Monika as she not only battles with her inner demons but also struggles with the challenges that come with making and keeping friends.",released:"Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:39 +0000",download_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fsites.google.com\u002Fview\u002Fddnf-mod",screenshots:["NewFriendsActOne_screenshot1.jpg","NewFriendsActOne_screenshot2.jpg","NewFriendsActOne_screenshot3.jpg"],dir:"\u002Fmods\u002Fnew-friends-act-one",path:"\u002Fmods\u002Fnew-friends-act-one\u002Finfo",extension:".json",createdAt:a,updatedAt:a,releaseTime:1590969639000},dir:b,slug:"new-friends-act-one"}],fetch:{},mutations:b}}("2024-11-28T18:14:12.783Z",void 0)));
