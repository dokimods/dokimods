With that explained, what about the game-play?There will be 10~11 'routes' available, though that doesn't mean you'll have to play through the mod that many times. Each girl has two routes, a lover route and a friend route. You can only do one lover route at a time (so no harem), but you could technically clear multiple friend routes in a single playthrough. To give an idea, it's a similar system to what you would see in a Persona game.Two new characters are also introduced (hence the 10~11 routes), but one of them is totally optional if new characters aren't your thing.The potential of a stat system exists. Again, this is a similar system to what you'd see in a Persona game, with there being four \"stats\" that can be raised to unlock new scenes and interactions.
