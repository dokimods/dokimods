For those who don't know, both the sequel and the original are meant to be joke mods (the original a little less I guess). They are comedy mods that use satire. A select few might not find them funny, but to be fair, you have to have a high IQ to understand DDCC and DDCC2.If you haven't yet, you should play the original first since it will help you understand the story. Liked the first one? Then you're going to love this one. The positive feedback the first one got inspired me to create this sequel.
