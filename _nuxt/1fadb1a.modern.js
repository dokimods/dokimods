The story follows a redesigned protagonist and his experience joining the club. By redesign, I mean he was given a personality different to the base game, as well as a past that will play into his general outlook and interactions with the dokis. He\'s sort of a blend between the personalities of the protagonists from these stories: \\"My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU,\\" \\"Bunny-Girl Senpai,\\" and \\"The Fruit of Grisaia.\\" I\'ve never played the mod \\"Fruits of the Literature Club\\", so there may be a slight overlap due to our similar inspirations, but if there is it will likely be negligible. With that explained, what about the game-play?There will be 10~11 \'routes\' available, though that doesn\'t mean you\'ll have to play through the mod that many times. Each girl has two routes, a lover route and a friend route. You can only do one lover route at a time (so no harem), but you could technically clear multiple friend routes in a single playthrough. To give an idea, it\'s a similar system to what you would see in a Persona game.Two new characters are also introduced (hence the 10~11 routes), but one of them is totally optional if new characters aren\'t your thing.The potential of a stat system exists. Again, this is a similar system to what you\'d see in a Persona game, with there being four \\"stats\\" that can be raised to unlock new scenes and interactions.

There is still poem writing, still drama between the club members, and still all the loveable quirks in the dialogue. However, this game will be much larger. Act 1 has 5 ways to end (though this trickles into only 3 distinct ways to play through Act 2). There are four new male characters, each with distinct personalities and ties to the Doki girls we know and love.
